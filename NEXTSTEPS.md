Following items were discussed with the appropriate stakeholders regarding the final outcome of this project exercise.

*    The observed accuracy, even with the most accurate model, is quite lower than the desired accuracy of 70%. However, it seems to be fairly better than random coin-toss. So we have decided to invest more effort and time on this to iterate and optimize. **AI-Rajat:** To plan and document the next iteration.

*    While the accuracy lift is desirable, to efficiently target and onboard new customers, it is more important to be able to classify a customer with minimum data and early on in their journey. So we have decided to NOT use longer durations of usage data for this model. Having less accurate classification after first 7 days is way better than having super accurate classification after first 30 days of customer start date.

*    This model needs to be A/B tested with production data for new customers. **AI-Rajat:** Work with the testing and targeting teams to plan and setup appropriate testing.

*    From the perspective of longer term customer targeting, it will be good to have seperate models to classify customers as "PHOTOGRAPHERS" at various stages of their journey through Adobe experience. A seperate effort to build multiple classifers working at different customer journey stages to be discussed as follow-up.
