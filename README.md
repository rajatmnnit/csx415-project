### About

This is a Classifier which classifies a given user as a "PHOTOGRAPHER" or "OTHER" based on their usage in first few days after subscribing to a Adobe Creative Cloud Photography plan.

_**NOTE:** All documentation, including this one, are living components of this project. Please keep them updated._


### Project Organization

This project is primarily built using R, using RStudio as IDE. It follows [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html) framework for development and organization of code fairly by-the-book with minor adjustments as listed below:

*    **munge** - There is no code for munging (and no corresponding directory). The primary reason for this is that the data required for this project comes from three different enterprise data marts which have specific handling and anonymization requirements to honor Adobe's privacy policies. Due to this the data for this project is available pre-munged.
*    Directories which were not required have been cleaned-up and removed for better code maintenance.
*    **pkgs** - A new directory has been introduced to store code, model and data which manifests as various R packages.

Organization of all other code, documents, reports, graphs etc. should be self-explanatory.
